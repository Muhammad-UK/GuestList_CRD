Welcome to the GuestLists CRD!

This single-page application has been build using Vite, React, and TypeScript.

It is a pretty simple website that simply displays a list of Guests from an API and allows users to create more guests as they please with a form. This "create guests" option actually updates the API's data itself instead of adjusting values locally.
